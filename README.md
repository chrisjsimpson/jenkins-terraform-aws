Deploys a jenkins instance using terraform within its own vpc.

Given the following aws user guide:
https://d1.awsstatic.com/Projects/P5505030/aws-project_Jenkins-build-server.pdf

A terraform plan is modeled on the above user guide so that no infra has to be deployed manually.

Educational purposes only, the aws guide is not fit for production.

TODO tweak / branch a secure deployment example.
